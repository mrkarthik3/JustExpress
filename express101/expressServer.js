// NODEJS IS the language
// Express is Node. 

// This is just like 
// Javascript is the language 
// React is Javascript. It is based on Javascript. (React is a JS framework)

// Similarly Express is a NodeJS framework.

// Express is unopinionated...
// That means.... you are not forced to use any DB/FrontEnd framework... for your project
// Express works with Postgres and MySQL the same... Just as an example.
